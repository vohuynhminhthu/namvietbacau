                <h3> 1 / Wash mushrooms thoroughly </h3>
                <p> Mushrooms contain Lysergic, a substance that can be converted into sunlight into Vitamin D. Mushrooms if washed off or soaked in water for a long time can cause loss of nutrients in fresh mushrooms. </p>
                <br>
                <h3> 2 / Cook the mushrooms in an aluminum pot </h3>

                <br>
                <h3> 5 / Not fully cooked </h3>
                <p> It is necessary to boil the mushrooms for 5-10 minutes to make sure the mushrooms are fully cooked to ensure hygiene and not harmful to your body. </p>
                <br>
                <h3> 6 / Eat mushrooms with cold drinks </h3>
                <p> Mushrooms are welding and tonic if you drink cold food, you will have a cold stomach, prone to abdominal pain, discomfort, harmful to health.</p>
